## Biography

I am currently an assistant professor in the [<font color="0000dd">Technology Center of Software Engineering (TCSE)</font>](http://www.tcse.cn/) at the [<font color="0000dd">Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)</font>](http://www.iscas.ac.cn/). My research interests lie in the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence, with a focus on **intelligent software testing**. The objective of my research is to achieve effective software testing while facilitating timely software maintenance by combining the respective strengths of classical code analysis techniques and cutting-edge big model techniques.
